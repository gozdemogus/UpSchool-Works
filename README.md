## Personal Projects
In this folder, you can find the projects that I have individually developed.

### Individual Projects

My personal projects where I implement the knowledge I have developed and acquired in order to apply what I have learned throughout the process.

- **[JobFinder Project:](https://github.com/gozdemogus/identity-netcore-jobsearch-project/)** A web application similar to [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/) where users can register and create profiles, apply for job advertisements and also withdraw, message other users on the site, view company profile information and other user information, follow/unfollow users, create an online CV and download it as a PDF.
- **[.NET Core Blog Project:](https://github.com/gozdemogus/blog-project-core-identity-api/)** A [Medium](https://medium.com/)-like blog project that hosts culture-art content. A dynamic, admin panel project that captures Turkey's popular music data, where the user can register to the system and perform login-exit and other identity operations.
- **[Hotel API Project:](https://github.com/gozdemogus/hotel-api-produce-consume/)** Hotel reservation site providing CRUD operations developed with API on the backend and .NET Core application on the front end
- **[Currency App:](https://github.com/gozdemogus/currency-report-app/)** Aims to extract one-month dollar and euro exchange rates by consuming Exchange Rates Data API and convert the data of the highest 5 days in this data into pie charts and also prepare excel reports of 1-month data.
